The dataset includes 424 images.
Contruction-safety-gears are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -26 and +26 degrees
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 11 percent of pixels
